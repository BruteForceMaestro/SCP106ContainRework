# SCP106ContainRework
The main thing that you'll need to edit is the config. It has the main things like:

## s_c_p106_door_open_minutes - how far later in the round will the 106 room's doors will open - default: 15. 

When trying to open the door while it's still locked, it will show a hint "SCP-106's chamber isn't ready for the initiation of the recall protocol." as 106 destroyed his chamber when he breached containemnt. 

When 106's chamber doors unlock, Cassie will say "SCP 1 0 6 ready for recontainment protocol"

## recontainment_chance - upon pushing the button, what is the chance the 106 will be contained (out of 100). - default: 25. 

If recontaiment fails, Cassie will say "Attention all personnel . SCP 1 0 6 Recontainment Protocol Failure Detected". The button will not be able to be pushed again.
